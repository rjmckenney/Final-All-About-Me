       <p class="text-style text-indent">Hello my name is Rhonda Mckenney.
          I am from <strong>Miami,Florida</strong> where most people pronounce the “L” in salmon and Cuban coffee
          is our National drink (We think that we are our own country, LOL). I am the second oldest
          of four children, and my parents will be married 47 years next month. I love my family
          and enjoy spending time with them. Every chance that I get I am in Miami where my siblings
          live or Texas where my parents now live. When I am in Miami I enjoy relaxing at the beach, eating
          at my favorite Cuban restaurant "La Carreta" or just being with my family. </p>
         <p class="text-style text-indent"> I taught elementary for sixteen years; mostly in Georgia, one year in Ft. Lauderdale,Florida,
          and three years in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. Other than Georgia and Florida I have lived in
           California, Texas and the United Arab Emirates. Traveling the globe is what I
          truly enjoy doing. To travel is to Live…, is one of my favorite travel quotes. I have enjoyed every country 
          that I have visited whether the experience was positive or not so positive. When I travel I get to see, explore, 
          and taste the world. I have visited several countries in the Asia, Africa, the Caribbean, the Middle East, 
          Europe and one country in South America. My favorite foods are just about everything that is Caribbean, 
          Ethiopian and Indian. I am open to trying “almost” any food once. 
          <p class="text-style text-indent"> I <strong>enjoy music</strong>, because I love to sing. My favorite musical artists are Stevie Wonder(thanks to my first
          grade teacher Ms. Khan who would play the song Ebony and Ivory often), Fred Hammond, Celia Cruz, Anderson Paak, Maxwell, 
          OutKast, and Marc Anthony. I enjoy reading because it takes you places without needing a passport.
          Last but not least, I enjoy cooking because I like to eat and try new recipes.
